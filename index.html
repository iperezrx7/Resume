Their duties include reconciling bank records, drafting financial documents and invoicing customers or collecting payments.

Organize the bookkeeping processes of the company. Evaluate financial budgets and track expenses. Draft and report financial presentations. Reconcile financial books including incoming and outgoing funds.

They review financial statements for errors and make adjustments accordingly. Their job is to use software to input data into several financial documents like a companyâ€™s profit and loss statement. They may also perform certain clerical duties like taking notes during meetings, making copies and scanning documents to add to a digital filing system. Accounting Assistants will typically have certain prerequisite qualifications and skills which will help them succeed in their role, which can include: Good computer skills with a  knowledge of common bookkeeping and spreadsheet programs. Math skills. Teamwork skills. Strong written and verbal communication skills. Attention to detail.

There are some colleges that also offer a certificate in Accounting Assistant studies. These degrees prepare candidates to manage the expected financial responsibilities of an Accounting Assistant. Because an Accounting Assistant is considered an entry-level position, it is common for current accounting students to pursue a position as one while they are studying to become an Accountant.Whether or not previous experience is required to work as an Accounting Assistant will depend on the needs of the organization. Some companies may prefer to hire an Accounting Assistant and then train them within whereas other companies prefer candidates with previous bookkeeping and financial experience.

Accounting Assistants typically work for corporations as a part of their accounting or finance department. They may also work for private institutions, government agencies and individuals who operate sole-proprietorships. They usually work in an office setting, but if they work for Traveling Accountants or Auditors, they may move from city to city with them, completing temporary assignments as needed. Who an Accounting Assistant reports to may depend on the size of the department and the number of other assistants available.

In larger corporations, an Accounting Assistant may report to one Accountant in particular, working closely with them to complete their daily job duties.
